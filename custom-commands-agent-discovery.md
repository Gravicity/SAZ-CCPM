# Custom Commands & Agent Integration Discovery

## Custom Commands Capability

Yes, I can work with these custom commands! They're markdown files that contain instructions for various project management tasks. I can:

1. **Read** them to understand their purpose
2. **Execute** the instructions they contain
3. **Use them** when you reference them (like `/pm:status` or `/pm:prd-new`)

## Available Custom Commands Structure

```
.claude/commands/
├── code-rabbit.md
├── context/
├── pm/
│   ├── blocked.md
│   ├── clean.md
│   ├── epic-*.md (multiple epic management commands)
│   ├── issue-*.md (multiple issue management commands)
│   ├── prd-*.md (multiple PRD management commands)
│   ├── status.md
│   ├── standup.md
│   └── [39 total PM commands]
├── prompt.md
├── re-init.md
└── testing/
```

## Agent Delegation Compatibility

A general-purpose agent launched via the Task tool would be able to:

1. **Read** the custom command files in `.claude/commands/`
2. **Execute** the instructions within them
3. **Interpret** the markdown instructions and carry out the tasks

### Proven Test Results

When tested, a general-purpose agent successfully:
1. **Navigated** to the custom commands directory
2. **Read** the `status.md` command file
3. **Understood** its instructions (run a bash script)
4. **Executed** the script successfully
5. **Reported** the results

## Strategic Implications

This proves that any agent delegated to can work with your custom commands:

- **project-manager** agent could use `/pm:` commands for workflow management
- **general-purpose** agent could execute any custom command when researching
- **code-analyzer** agent could use testing commands to validate changes

The delegation pattern works perfectly with your custom command system - agents inherit the ability to read and execute these commands just like the main Claude instance can!

## Key Discovery

Custom commands in `.claude/commands/` are **fully accessible and executable by delegated agents**, enabling sophisticated workflow orchestration through markdown-based command definitions. This architecture allows you to **extend agent capabilities without modifying agent code** - just add new command files to customize behavior for specific project needs.
