> **Natural conversation, professional execution.** From "I want to build something" to deployed code in production.

SAZ-CCPM combines conversational AI intelligence with battle-tested project management workflows and intelligent service integration. Start with a vague idea, end with production code. No complex commands, no learning curve - just natural conversation that scales from prototype to enterprise.

## 🚀 Quick Start (< 2 minutes)

### 1. Install SAZ-CCPM

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /path/to/your/project

# Install (Unix/Linux/macOS)
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gravicity/SAZ-CCPM/main/install/ccpm.sh | bash

# Or Windows (PowerShell)
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gravicity/SAZ-CCPM/main/install/ccpm.bat | iex
```

### 2. Start Building

First, initialize the project management system (one-time setup):
```bash
/pm:init

# This command:
# - Installs GitHub CLI for issue tracking (if needed)
# - Sets up GitHub authentication
# - Creates .claude/ directory structure
# - Installs gh-sub-issue extension for task hierarchies
# - Prepares your project for professional development workflow

# Note: SAZ-CCPM automatically checks PM initialization status and will
# remind you to run /pm:init if needed, preventing workflow issues
```

#### For New Projects (Most Common - Brainstorming-First):
```bash
# After /pm:init, just talk naturally!
"I want to build something with AI for small businesses"

# SAZ-CCPM will:
# - Route to brainstorming-specialist (explores different AI business concepts)
# - Generate 3-5 concepts: AI CRM assistant, inventory optimizer, etc.
# - User selects preferred concept
# - Route to project-manager (PRD → checkpoint for review → tasks)
```

#### For Highly Detailed Requirements (Skip Brainstorming):
```bash
"Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication using Firebase Auth with Google and GitHub 
providers, including JWT token refresh, role-based access control with admin/user 
roles, and session management with 24-hour expiry"

# SAZ-CCPM will:
# - Detect highly detailed spec → route directly to project-manager
# - Create technical PRD, delegate Firebase setup to mcp-handler
# - Create technical PRD → checkpoint for user review → break into tasks
```

#### For Existing Projects (Enhancing/Fixing):
```bash
# After /pm:init, analyze your existing code (optional but recommended)
/context:create

# Then just talk naturally!
"I need user authentication but not sure which approach"

# SAZ-CCPM will:
# - Route to brainstorming-specialist (explores auth approaches)
# - Consider: OAuth providers, magic links, traditional login, etc.
# - User selects approach → project-manager creates implementation plan
```

**Note:** After `/pm:init`, everything else is natural language - just describe what you want!

## 🎯 How It Works

### Natural Language First
Just describe what you want to build. No commands necessary:

```
You: "I need a multi-tenant SaaS with Stripe payments"
SAZ: 💡 Let me explore some concepts for your SaaS platform...
     [Generates 3-5 detailed concepts with competitive analysis]
     [You choose one]
     [Automatically creates PRD and implementation plan]
     [Begins building with specialized agents]
```

### Intelligent Two-Phase Workflow

SAZ-CCPM uses a two-phase approach for optimal routing:

**Phase 1: Initial Assessment** (< 5 seconds)
- ALL requests first go through project-manager for rapid assessment
- Analyzes project state, checks PM initialization, determines optimal workflow

**Phase 2: Specialized Execution**
| Intent Pattern | Triggers | Final Routing |
|----------------|----------|--------------|
| 🚨 **Emergency** | "urgent", "critical", "down", "broken", "production failing" | → code-analyzer (fast-tracked) |
| 💡 **Most Projects** | "SaaS dashboard", "e-commerce site", "add auth", "mobile app" | → brainstorming-specialist → implementation |
| 🎯 **Detailed Specs** | "Implement OAuth 2.0 with Firebase Auth and Google/GitHub providers" | → direct implementation (with mcp-handler if needed) |
| 🔌 **Pure Services** | "Firebase setup", "screenshot [URL]", "YouTube transcript" | → mcp-handler |
| 🔍 **Analysis** | "bug", "error", "trace logic", "code review" | → code-analyzer OR file-analyzer |
| 🧪 **Testing** | "run tests", "test this", "are tests passing" | → test-runner (exclusive)


## 🎯 When to Brainstorm vs. Skip to Implementation

**Brainstorming triggers** (vague/exploratory):
- "I want to build something with AI"
- "Add authentication but not sure which approach"  
- "Create a dashboard for my users"
- "Build a SaaS for small businesses"

**Skip to implementation** (detailed specs):
- "Implement OAuth 2.0 with Firebase Auth using Google/GitHub providers, JWT refresh tokens, and role-based access control"
- "Add Stripe webhook handling for failed payment notifications with retry logic and email alerts"
- "Create REST API endpoints for user CRUD operations with pagination, filtering, and caching"

**The threshold**: If your request includes specific technologies, implementation details, or technical constraints, it bypasses brainstorming.

## 💡 The Brainstorming-First Approach

### From Vague to Concrete
```
Vague Idea → Brainstorming → Multiple Concepts → Feasibility Analysis → 
Competitive Research → Starting Templates → Choose One → PRD → 
Implementation → Deployed Code
```

### What You Get from Brainstorming:
- **3-5 Concrete Concepts** with technical approaches
- **Competitive Analysis** of existing solutions
- **GitHub Templates** to accelerate development
- **Feasibility Scores** for each option
- **Clear Next Steps** to begin building

Example output:
```markdown
💡 CONCEPT 1: AI-Powered Analytics Dashboard
- Target: Small business owners
- Competitive Advantage: No-code AI insights
- Starting Template: github.com/vercel/analytics-starter
- Feasibility: 85% (2-3 weeks)
- Similar to: Mixpanel but simpler

💡 CONCEPT 2: Team Collaboration Hub
- Target: Remote development teams  
- Competitive Advantage: Built-in AI assistant
- Starting Template: github.com/supabase/team-hub
- Feasibility: 70% (3-4 weeks)
- Similar to: Slack + Jira integrated
```

## 🛠️ Core Capabilities

### Project Management Evolution

| Traditional Dev | Basic AI Coding | SAZ-CCPM v2.2+ |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Lost context between sessions | Some memory | **Persistent project state + context caching** |
| Serial task execution | Single thread | **10+ parallel agents** |
| Vibe coding from memory | Basic specs | **Brainstorm → Spec → Build** |
| Hidden progress | Chat logs | **GitHub audit trail** |
| Complex commands | Some automation | **90% natural language** |
| Manual service setup | Basic integrations | **Smart MCP gateway** |
| Outdated packages | Training cutoff | **Real-time version checking** |
| Generic outputs | Fixed templates | **Adaptive to input specificity** |

## 🔌 MCP Ecosystem Integration

### Context-Efficient Service Operations

Traditional MCP implementations load all services simultaneously, consuming excessive context:
- **Standard approach**: ~5 MCPs loaded = ~10,000 tokens (20% of available context)
- **SAZ-CCPM approach**: Load only required MCP = ~2,000 tokens per operation

**Smart MCP Gateway Benefits:**
- **Intelligent routing**: Automatically detects which service you need
- **Per-request isolation**: Loads only the specific MCP required
- **Auto-discovery**: Finds and configures missing MCPs from community repositories
- **Service orchestration**: Integrates external services within project workflows

### Supported Integrations
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth, Supabase, Auth0
- **Databases**: Firestore, PostgreSQL, Supabase
- **Deployment**: Vercel, Netlify, Firebase Hosting
- **Media**: Screenshots (Playwright), YouTube transcripts
- **Data**: Web scraping, API integrations, content extraction
- **Communication**: Slack, GitHub, webhook automation

### The Power of Parallel Execution + Service Integration

One "implement authentication" task becomes:
- **Agent 1**: Database schema and migrations
- **Agent 2**: API endpoints and middleware  
- **Agent 3**: Frontend components and forms
- **Agent 4**: Test suites and validation
- **Agent 5**: Documentation and examples
- **MCP Gateway**: Auto-configures Firebase Auth, handles deployment

All running **simultaneously** with **intelligent service orchestration**. A 5-day task completes in 1 day.

### GitHub as the Backbone

Why GitHub Issues?
- **Team Visibility**: Everyone sees AI progress in real-time
- **Human-AI Handoffs**: Seamless collaboration between humans and agents
- **Existing Tools**: Works with your current GitHub workflow
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history from idea to deployment

**Key Structure Principles:**
- New projects are created in their own subfolders by default
- Root directory stays clean with only .claude/ and project folders
- SAZ-CCPM docs are in .claude/saz-docs/ to avoid conflicts
- PRDs now include UI/UX design sections with wireframes

## 📋 Essential Commands

- `project-manager` performs rapid assessment (< 5 seconds)
- Checks PM initialization status automatically
- Analyzes project state using `ls` command
- Determines optimal workflow and routing

**Phase 2: Specialized Execution**
SAZ-CCPM routes to specialized agents based on assessment:
- **Emergency keywords** → code-analyzer (fast-tracked for immediate fix)
- **Vague ideas** → brainstorming-specialist → concept generation
- **Clear requirements** → direct implementation → full CCPM workflow
- **External services** → mcp-handler → service integration
- **Test requests** → test-runner (exclusive test execution)
- **Existing code analysis** → code-analyzer → improvements

Context optimization through specialized agents:
- `brainstorming-specialist` for concept generation with UI/UX design
- `project-manager` for initial assessment and workflow routing
- `mcp-handler` for external service integration (context-efficient)
- `code-analyzer` for debugging and code analysis
- `file-analyzer` for logs, configs, and large files
- `test-runner` for exclusive test execution and validation
- `parallel-worker` for concurrent task execution
- Smart MCP gateway loads only required services (context-efficient)


### Context Persistence
The system maintains project context across sessions:
- Preserves architectural decisions in `.claude/context/`
- Tracks proven patterns in `.claude/epics/`
- Documents technical choices in PRDs
- Maintains GitHub issue history for audit trail

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Command not found"**
- SAZ-CCPM will automatically detect and prompt you to run `/pm:init`
- If prompted manually, run `/pm:init` first
- Check `.claude/commands/` exists

**"PM system not initialized"**
- SAZ-CCPM now automatically checks PM initialization status
- Will add `/pm:init` to todos if GitHub CLI not authenticated
- Will detect missing `.claude/prds/` or `.claude/epics/` directories

**"Agent not available"**  
- Restart Claude Code: `Ctrl+C` twice, then `claude --resume`
- Check `.claude/agents/` for agent files

**"GitHub sync failed"**
- Verify `gh` CLI is authenticated: `gh auth status`
- Check repository permissions
- Ensure remote isn't pointing to SAZ-CCPM template repo

**"Context overflow"**
- Use parallel agents to distribute work
- Run `/pm:clean` to archive completed tasks
- Leverage specialized agents for focused work

**"Lost context after restart"**
- Run `/context:prime` to reload project understanding
- Then `/pm:status` to see current work
- Continue where you left off

**"Tests not running properly"**
- Always use test-runner agent for test execution
- Never run tests directly with Bash commands
- Check `.claude/scripts/test-and-log.sh` exists
